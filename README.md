Dataset
I have used Balanced EMNIST dataset
Balanced dataset
The EMNIST Balanced dataset is meant to address the balance issues in the ByClass and ByMerge datasets. It is derived from the ByMerge dataset to reduce mis-classification errors due to capital and lower case letters and also has an equal number of samples per class. This dataset is meant to be the most applicable.
